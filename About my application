About my application

My application does a few different things. There are a lot of pictures of dogs, so I hope you like them! When you run the application and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ you will see a page where are given the form to enter your name and age. This will take you to another page that says [name] is [age] years old down and then across what year you were born in. On the original page, there is also a link to the puppy route. Please make sure to enter all the information on the first page or an error will occur. Once you go to the results page, there is a link to both the first form or the puppy page. From the puppy page, you enter your favorite type of dog in which you are taken to a new page that shows pictures of dogs with a link to the humane society. If you do not enter one of the routes, you will be given a 404 error where there is pictures of a dog and a link to the original form. There is also cookies built in so if you skip the first link and go to the form page, you will be told you skipped a few steps and to go back to the original link with more pictures of dogs.
